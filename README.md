## Note
- Password and username are included for your convenience. It is not normal practice.
- For Replit please get the url in the built in web view and put it in a new tab or use the open website button. It seems that Replit does not allow the url to be modified within the built-in web view which can cause some issues with redirects. If using the built in web view you will have to manually navigate using the nav bar. You may need to extend the built in window to see all options
